## pick one of these  programming Languages  To Become An Android Developer

With the Outreach of Android devices in Africa ,Europe and other part of the world, android developers are significantly in-demand in most tech companies,therefore to be part of this moving train you need to learn one of these powerful programming language.

So what is the best language for an Android developer to learn first? Which language has the easiest learning curve, greatest scalability and versatility to eventually become a successful Android developer in your career journey?

## Java programming language


Java is also the most popular language currently used for Android app development (it was the first official language of Android development, although kotlin is taking the lead in recent years). Currently, most of the mobile apps featured within the Google Play Store were created by using this language. One of the main reasons for this is that the Java programming language is a platform independent language that makes use of the java virtual machine which convert the java bytecode into machine code.it also makes use of the code security which is implemented on the java runtime environment.
The disadvantage of Java is that the language is not easy to learn for beginners, and it requires experience working and writing code with it to create complex mobile apps and effectively tackle the app development process. Java is a difficult language to learn because it contains complex topics like constructors, null pointer exceptions, concurrency, checked exceptions, garbage collection thread,software development kit (sdk) as opposed simpler beginner-friendly languages like Python or Ruby.


## Dart programming language

Dart is a programming language created by google designed for app development.it is  an object oriented language that can be compiled to either native code or javascript.This language is beginner friendly compared to java.it is mostly used to create a frontend user interfaces for the web and mobile apps. The cons of this language is that, it is Strongly Typed. Since Dart is a compiled language so you cannot execute your code directly; instead, the compiler parses it and transfer it into machine code.

## HTML/CSS/JavaScript

Android apps can also be developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through the Adobe PhoneGap framework, which is powered by Apache Cordova. The PhoneGap framework essentially allows the usage of web development skills to create hybrid apps, which are displayed through “WebView” but remain packaged like a standard Android app.

<!-- While Apple often gets much of the hype and glitter in the United States and other Western economies, Android devices remain far more prevalent and popular throughout the world. From Samsung to LG, Huawei to Google, there are a plethora of companies creating Android-powered devices that only thrive thanks to the capabilities and possibilities of Android operating systems. This also means that because of the importance of good Android OS options, Android developers continue to be in significant demand around the world.

<!-- However, unlike Apple, which predominantly uses iOS in terms of development and offers a more limited array of devices, Android devices offer a much greater array of hardware opportunities and challengers. Additionally, the variety of manufacturers means that Android developers often need significant technical chops and a knowledge of useful and versatile programming languages to be truly effective and successful. While Apple developers can often dive deep into Swift to begin their careers, Android developers have a bigger array of languages to choose from when picking out coding classes or learning their first programming language. -->
<!-- ## Kotlin
As the Google-official appointed successor to Java as its chosen language, Kotlin has rapidly grown to occupy a considerable market share in the Android development community. Developed just a few years ago and anointed by Google as the official Android language in 2019, Kotlin’s simplicity, efficiency, and cross-compatibility with Java make it an attractive option for developers, either new or experienced and looking for a new language to learn. Like any language designed with a specific use case in mind, Kotlin also offers enhancements and fixes that make it better suited to tackle coding challenges and problems that had long faced Java developers writing code specifically for Android apps.

By design, Kotlin offers a Java alternative with modern features, an attractive layout, and a more readable code. In comparison, Java is faster and more mature, more secure, and allows developers to write shorter codes. Kotlin also has limited uses outside of the Android development sector, which means it is a better option for people who want to specialize in the Android niche, or who will have the time to learn additional languages later in their careers instead. -->
