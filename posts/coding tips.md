<h3>Here are some Tips That Will Keep You Motivated When Learning To Code.</h3>

<ol>
<li>Pick a niche(speciality)</li>
<li>Get a well organised resources for your niche</li>
<li>Learn</li>
<li>Build something from what you have learnt</li>
<li>Network</li>
</ol>

<h3>1. PICK A NICHE</h3>
<p>There is a proverb that says</p>
<blockquote> "if you want to succeed limit yourself"</blockquote>

<p>Firstly,when starting to code it is important that you pick a niche.This make sure that you dont overwhelm yourself. it limit your learning and gives you the opportunity to devote your attention to a particular subject, so you can finally create an entry point.</p>

<p>Software devolopment is very versatile,so you need to start by getting an overview of what programming and software development involves.</p>

<p>After you have gotten a genneral overview,you should pick a particular area of specialization that really excites you.</p>
<blockquote>"BELIEVE IN YOURSELF AND YOU ARE HALFWAY THERE" -Theodore Roosevelt</blockquote>

<h3>2. FIND STRUCTURED LEARNING RESOURCES FOR YOUR NICHE</h3>

<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script>
<p>Congratulation on picking a niche!!!.The next step is to find a structured learning resources that has progressive list and subject alongside some code exercise for practice.</p>

<h4>There are factors you need to consider when choosing a learning resources</h4>
  <ol>
<li>What languages and technologies are used in this field?</li>
<li>what tools you need either some software environment or code editor?(VS-CODE,SUBLIME TEXT,WEBSTORM E.T.C)</li>
<li>what is your learning order,most field require you to learn one tool/language first before learning another to build your fundamental knowledge.Remember know the fundamental before moving forward.</li>
 </ol>

 <h3>3. LEARN</h3>
 <p>Another saying goes</p>
 <blockquote>"If you chase two rabbits,you will not catch any"</blockquote>
 <p>Good job,you have done it.you have figured out what you need to learn to smash your goals by finding a learning resources to use.Now it is time to learn those resources sequentially,not simultaneously.</p>

 <h4>BE CONSISTENT</h4>
 <p>The first thing to do is to set aside time for your learning.Set a specific time everyday during your daily scheduled within which you will learn and be selfish about it</p>

 <p>Two hours learning everyday is alot better than 15 hours of learning in one day.It is pertinent to note that consistency is a key in a self-taught process.</p>

 <h4>SET GOALS</h4>
 <p> Also,for effective learning you have to set weekly goals so you can hold yourself accountable.what do you want to know or be able to do at the end of the month?.How will ou structure your learning process per week to be able to achieve this goal.</p>

 <h4>STAY FOCUSED</h4>
 <P>It is also important that you remember to focus on your outlined learning plan and your chosen leraning resources</p>

 <p>In the tech-spehere, there is always a shiny new object i.e something new to learn.Please dont get carried away or overwhelmed,that's the reason why you need to focus.</p>
 <blockquote>One completed tutorial is better than 10 sampled tutorial</blockquote>

<h3>4. BUILD SOMETHING! (PROJECT)</h3>
<blockquote>"The difference between you and those with talent is practice; a lot of it"</blockquote>

<p>As a beginner in web-development,it is easy to get stuck in the tutrial zone,but building projects is mutually exclusive to the learning phase and it makes you become a better developer because by building project,it makes you practice what you have learnt in the tutorial zone</p>

<p>One way to get some practice is,at the end of every module,think of feature that you can add to the project that you have coded.Just try to build something with the new knowledge that you have gained in the tutorial.</p>
<script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-5322277310257930"
     crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block; text-align:center;"
     data-ad-layout="in-article"
     data-ad-format="fluid"
     data-ad-client="ca-pub-5322277310257930"
     data-ad-slot="5558667291"></ins>
<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script>
<p>It doesn't have to be too fancy.The most important thing is that you have written the code,run into errors,google how to debug it and gain more understanding.<blockquote>"Practice solidifies knowledge"</blockquote> so practice.One completed project is better than 10 watched tutorials.</p>

<h3>5. NETWORK</h3>
<p>To network simply means to learn in public and put yourself out there</p>

<h5>Join a community and attent Meetups</h5>
<p>A community challenges you and inspires you at the same time.You become aware of people who are in the same field as you are with the same struggle you have</p>

<h5>SELL YOURSELF</h5>
<p><blockquote>Opportunity no longer comes to the most qualified,it goes to the most <bold>visibly</bold> qualified</blockquote> selling yourself means talking about yourself and what you are currently doing.This gives you more experience and could open up a lot of opportunities for you</p>

<p>Set up a git-hub account,learn how to use the git-hub environment,git commands e.t.c and push code there for future reference.You can equally start a twitter account and talk about what you are currently learning or building.</p>

<p>Lastly,remember your consistency and perseverance towards learning will definetly pay off.GOODLUCK!!!</p>
