<p> More than half of people worldwide access the internet using mobile devices instead of desktop computers. And if you only have a mobile device, you can still learn to code!</p>

<h5> In this article, you will learn about apps and resources you can use to code on a mobile device. Firstly, a smartphone can be used to learn practically anything. Everyone else is already doing it. YouTube videos, online tutorials, or publishing blog posts from a smartphone. There is a lot that you can do and learn with a smartphone.
</h5>
<p> But, surely with programming?

The short answer? Yes, you can learn to program using a smartphone. It will not be efficient, but you will be able to learn. You can even write functional programs, but doing this comes at a cost. And that cost is, that you’re locked into specific learning material.

If you want to write code on your smart device, all you have to do is download an application from the app store. Code editors for mobile devices have existed for many years. And a lot of programmers/Developers use them. Some even provide the means to compile programs right from the mobile device itself.
</p>
<p> Programming is more than writing code
Learning code syntax from a smartphone can be a lot of fun. You should do it if you’re interested in learning. But programming isn’t just about writing code. You also have to consider what you wish to build/develop

If your goal is to create a custom website, you will need to start learning HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT and some popular JavaScript frameworks like REACT., and if your goal is to start creating mobile applications then you will also need to start learning JAVA, FLUTTER, and if your goal is to start building games then you will also need to start learning c++,c#, python and by this point, it starts to become tedious to manage it all from a phone.
</p>

<p>Though, admittedly, it's not impossible. Ideally, you only use your phone to learn and master certain concepts and then transfer that knowledge back to your laptop/desktop sessions.

But, let’s talk about the different websites and mobile apps which provide the means to learn at least the basics of programming from your phone.
