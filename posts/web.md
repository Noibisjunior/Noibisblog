## pick one of these  programming Language to Become A Web Developer

However,web development remains the most important element that drives modern technology and the Internet. Companies and industries still need websites to interact with customers, organizations need websites to communicate with potential clients, and individuals need websites and web apps to promote their small business, club, group, Which means that the fading of web development is not likely to happen anytime soon.

## JavaScript

There is no doubt that JavaScript is the king of web development, and the most popular language among web developers around the globe. It’s also the only language that allows you to create web applications (either front-end(Angular,vue,react) or back-end(Node.js)) as well as mobile applications (using frameworks like React Native). Since most companies are interested in websites that can easily scale between computers, tablets, and mobile devices, the versatility ,efficiency and scalability of JavaScript makes the best choice for the modern age of web development.

The strength of JavaScript goes beyond operating on any browser and server (by using NodeJS), but especially the combination of frameworks and libraries that optimize JavaScript for web development and app development. Angular, React,and vue are key frameworks that optimize javascript in the frontend while Node.js powers it scalabilty on the backend -- The global community of javascript also offers all the benefits of any well-supported language -- numerous resources for receiving help or finding open sourced solutions for coding problems, networking opportunities to collaborate with other JavaScript developers.

## Python

While JavaScript is reigning as the king of web development, Python is nearly as popular around the globe; not only because of its useful applications for web development, but also for its versatility as an option for data science, machine learning and Artificial intelligence,Neural Network,Internet of Things (IOT) and others. Python is one of the best languages for beginners in programming to learn, due to its simple syntax (often considered the closest to plain English), simpler learning curve, and structural principles that makes easy to master.

Similar to JavaScript, Python also has huge community support and offers a large numbers of useful frameworks, libraries, and tools that can help new and experienced developers create a web application faster. For example, developers can use Django to create full-stack web applications, without writing excessive lines of code. Or, for developers who want more control, there’s Flask, an easy to use web development framework that allows for greater customization .

## PHP

PHP is also another programming language for web development.It is largely used for what is known as server-side or back-end development. As a “back-end” language, PHP code gets executed on the server and the client-side

PHP can load data from a server and put it into the HTML DOM, but it doesn’t have as much control over HTML as other languages like JavaScript. However, PHP can be used to connect to different databases like Mysql,postGress,mongoDB etc apply scripts to HTML, start sessions,end sessions and perform many other tasks.

PHP is widely used for:

Adding or modifying database information.
Creating dynamic content.
Creating, writing, opening, deleting, reading, and closing files on a server.
Sending or receiving cookies.
Receiving data from forms.
Performing data encryption
PHP not only generates HTML output but also generates output as PDF, XML, Flash, and other file types.

HTML/CSS - along with JavaScript, knowing HTML and CSS and how to manipulate them gives you an overview of web development languages to know.
